Something's not working. This section helps you figure out why and fix it.

## When things go wrong

Debugging distributed systems is hard. Resonate's durable execution model helps by preserving execution state across failures, but you still need to know where to look when something breaks.

**Start here:**

1. **Check the logs** - Server and SDK logs show what's happening at each step
2. **Look for error codes** - Resonate returns structured errors with codes you can search
3. **Use the troubleshooting guide** - Common problems and solutions

## What you'll find here

### [Errors](/debug/errors)

Resonate's error codes and what they mean. When you see an error, look it up here to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

### [Troubleshooting](/debug/troubleshooting)

Common problems and their solutions. Start here if you're seeing unexpected behavior but not sure what's causing it.

## Debug workflow

**When something fails:**

1. **Reproduce it** - Can you make it happen again? Consistent failures are easier to debug
2. **Check the logs** - Server logs (see [Logging](/deploy/logging)) show internal state changes
3. **Look up the error** - Find the error code in the [Errors](/debug/errors) reference
4. **Check common issues** - See if your problem matches something in [Troubleshooting](/debug/troubleshooting)
5. **Ask for help** - If you're stuck, share logs + error codes in [Discord](https://discord.gg/R4ad7T4U)

## What debugging looks like

**Durable execution changes debugging:**

In traditional systems, when a function fails, its execution state is lost. You see an error but can't inspect where it failed or what it was doing.

With Resonate, execution state is preserved in durable promises. When something fails:
- The promise shows the last successful checkpoint
- You can inspect input/output of each step
- You can retry from the failure point (not from scratch)
- Logs show the full execution history

This makes debugging **incremental** rather than blind.

## Beyond this section

- **Deployment issues** → See [Deploy](/deploy) for server startup, configuration, and infrastructure problems
- **Performance tuning** → See [Scaling](/deploy/scaling) for capacity and throughput optimization
- **Observability setup** → See [Logging](/deploy/logging), [Metrics](/deploy/metrics), and [Tracing](/deploy/tracing) to instrument your system

This section is about **fixing what's broken**. The other sections are about **building what works**.
