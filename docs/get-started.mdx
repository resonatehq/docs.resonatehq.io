**How to get started using Resonate?**

### 1. Install the CLI

You can install the CLI using brew or download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/releases)

```shell
brew install resonatehq/tap/resonate
```

### 2. Scaffold a project

You can list the available templates and their descriptions using:

```shell
resonate projects list
```

The language is indicated in the name of the template.

Scaffold a project from one of the listed templates.

```shell
resonate projects create --template <template_name> --name <your_project_name>
```

### 3. Optional - Run the Resonate Server

Depending on the template you choose and the features you want to use, you will want to run the Resonate Server:

```shell
resonate serve
```

### 4. Start customizing the template!

From here, if you are familiar with Resonate you can make your way using the [feature development guides](/develop), [tutorials](/learn), and [example apps](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples).
