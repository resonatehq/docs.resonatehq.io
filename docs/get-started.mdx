**How to get started using Resonate?**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="new" label="New project" default>

## Scaffold a new project

Follow these steps to get started with a new project using Resonate.

### 1. Install the CLI

You can install the CLI using brew or download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/releases)

```shell
brew install resonatehq/tap/resonate
```

### 2. Use a template

Scaffold a new project using a template from the CLI.

You can list the available templates and their descriptions using the following command:

```shell
resonate projects list
```

The language is indicated in the name of the template.

Scaffold a project from one of the listed templates.

```shell
resonate projects create --template <template_name> --name <your_project_name>
```

### 3. Run the Resonate Server

Run the Resonate Server as a remote promise store and message source.

Depending on the template you choose and the features you want to use, you will want to run the Resonate Server.

```shell
resonate serve
```

### 4. Customize the template!

Customize the template to your use case.
Use the [feature development guides](/develop), [tutorials](/learn), and [example apps](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples) as reference.

## Existing project

Select the programming language of your existing project and follow the steps to integrate Resonate.

      <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

## Python SDK

Integrate the Resonate Python SDK into your existing Python project.

### 1. Add the Python SDK as dependency

Add the Resonate Python SDK to your project as a dependency.

Add with uv:

```shell
uv add resonate-sdk
```

Add with pip:

```shell
pip install resonate-sdk
```

### 2. Initialize Resonate

Initialize Resonate in your Worker or Application Node.

Initialize using local memory as a promise store.
Using local memory does not require any additional dependencies (such as a Resonate Server).

```python
from resonate import Resonate

resonate = Resonate().local()
```

Initialize using a remote promise store and message source.
The default configuration connects to a locally running Resonate Server.

```python
from resonate import Resonate

resonate = Resonate.remote()
```

### 3. Register a function

Register a function with Resonate using the `register` decorator or the `register` method.

All functions registered with Resonate or called from a Resonate function must define Context as the first argument.

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg1, arg2):
    # Your function logic here
    return result
```

You can also register a function with the register method.

```python
def foo(ctx, arg1, arg2):
    # Your function logic here
    return result

resonate.register(foo)
```

### 4. Invoke a function

Invoke a function registered with Resonate using the `run` method or the `rpc` method.

If the function is in the same Worker or Application Node, you can invoke it directly with the run method.

```python
handle = foo.begin_run(promise_id, arg1, arg2)

# or using the Resonate instance
handle = resonate.begin_run(promise_id, "foo", arg1, arg2)
```

If the function is in a different Worker or Application Node, you can invoke it with the rpc method on the Resonate instance.
To do this, your worker must be connected to a remote store and message source (Resonate Server).

```python
handle = resonate
  .options(target="<transport_plugin>://<unique_id>@<group>/<id>")
  .begin_rpc("foo", promise_id, arg1, arg2)
```

### 5. Get the result

Getting the result of a function is a blocking operation.

Use the `.result()` method on the handle to get the result of the function.

```python
result = handle.result()
```

## TypeScript SDK

Integrate the Resonate TypeScript SDK into your existing TypeScript project.

:::caution New Release in development

A new release of the The TypeScript SDK is currently in development.
The following instructions are for the current version, which will not be compatible with the new version.
We recommend waiting for the new release to be available before integrating the TypeScript SDK into your project.

:::

### 1. Add TypeScript SDK as a dependency

Add the Resonate TypeScript SDK to your project as a dependency.

Add with npm:

```shell
npm install @resonatehq/sdk
```

Add with yarn:

```shell
yarn add @resonatehq/sdk
```

### 2. Initialize Resonate

Initialize Resonate in your Worker or Application Node.

```typescript
import { Resonate } from "@resonatehq/sdk";

const resonate = new Resonate();
```

### 3. Register a function

You can register a function with Resonate using the `register` method.
All functions registered with Resonate or called from a Resonate function must define `Context` as the first argument.

```typescript
resonate.register("custom-function-name", foo);

function foo(ctx: Context, arg1: any, arg2: any): any {
  // Your function logic here
  return result;
}
```

### 4. Invoke a function

The current version of the TypeScript SDK only supports calling functions locally.
And you must use the `start` method to initialize the Resonate instance before calling any functions.

```typescript
resonate.start();

const handle = resonate.run("custom-function-name", promiseId, arg1, arg2);
```

### 5. Get the result

Getting the result of a function is a blocking operation.

Await on the handle to get the result of the function.

```typescript
const result = await handle;
```
