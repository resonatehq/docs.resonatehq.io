Currently only the TypeScript SDK supports serverless worker shims.

## What is a serverless worker shim?

A serverless worker shim, also referred to as a binding, is a lightweight adapter that allows Resonate Workers to run in serverless (FaaS) environments such as Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.
The shim handles the communication between the Resonate SDK and the serverless platform, allowing you to run long-running workflows in ephemeral serverless functions with relative ease.

## Supported platforms

The following serverless platforms are supported with official Resonate worker shims:

### AWS Lambda

[Amazon Lambda worker shim | **TypeScript**](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate-faas-aws-ts)

**Quick example:**

```shell title="Install the shim package"
npm install @resonatehq/aws
```

Instead of importing Resonate from the SDK package, import it from the AWS shim package.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resonate } from "@resonatehq/aws";
import { countdown } from "./count";

const resonate = new Resonate();

resonate.register("countdown", countdown);

export const handler = resonate.httpHandler();
```

### Cloudflare Workers

[Cloudflare Workers worker shim | **TypeScript**](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate-faas-cloudflare-ts)

**Quick example:**

```shell title="Install the shim package"
npm install @resonatehq/cloudflare
```

Instead of importing Resonate from the SDK package, import it from the Cloudflare shim package.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resonate } from "@resonatehq/cloudflare";
import { countdown } from "./count";

const resonate = new Resonate();

resonate.register("countdown", countdown);

export default resonate.handlerHttp();
```

Ready to use example apps:

- [Durable Counter with Cloudflare Workers | TypeScript](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-countdown-cloudflare-ts)
- [Deep Research Agent with Cloudflare Workers | TypeScript](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-openai-deep-research-agent-cloudflare-ts)

### Google Cloud Functions

[Google Cloud Functions worker shim | **TypeScript**](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate-faas-gcp-ts)

**Quick example:**

```shell title="Install the shim package"
npm install @resonatehq/gcp
```

Instead of importing Resonate from the SDK package, import it from the GCP shim package.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resonate } from "@resonatehq/gcp";
import { countdown } from "./count";

const resonate = new Resonate();

resonate.register("countdown", countdown);

export const handler = resonate.handlerHttp();
```

- [Durable Counter with GCP Functions | TypeScript](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-countdown-gcp-ts)
- [Deep Research Agent with GCP Functions | TypeScript](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-openai-deep-research-agent-gcp-ts)

### Supabase Edge Functions

[Supabase Edge Functions worker shim | **TypeScript**](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate-faas-supabase-ts)

**Quick example:**

```shell title="Install the shim package"
npm install @resonatehq/supabase
```

Instead of importing Resonate from the SDK package, import it from the Supabase shim package.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resonate } from "@resonatehq/supabase";
import { countdown } from "./count";

const resonate = new Resonate();
resonate.register("countdown", countdown);

resonate.httpHandler();
```
