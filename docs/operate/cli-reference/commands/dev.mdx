The `dev` command is a convenience alias that starts the Resonate server with
sensible defaults for local development.

```shell
resonate dev [flags]
```

Behind the scenes the alias expands to:

```shell
resonate serve --aio-store-sqlite-path ':memory:' --aio-store-postgres-query 'sslmode=disable'
```

This configuration boots the server with an in-memory SQLite store and disables
PostgreSQL SSL verification so you can connect to local databases without
additional configuration.

## Flags

`resonate dev` accepts the same flags as
[`resonate serve`](./serve). Any overrides you provide will be merged with the
development defaults shown above.
