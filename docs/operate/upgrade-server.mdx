When you upgrade your Resonate Server, you are replacing the current binary with a new one.

You will not need to touch or reconfigure your existing database.

If a database schema migration is required, you will be notified by server logs when you start the new version.
Migration instructions will be provided in the release notes.

### Upgrade with brew

If you installed the Resonate Server using Homebrew, you can upgrade it with the following commands:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade resonate
```

### Upgrade manually

If you installed the Resonate Server manually by downloading the binary, you can upgrade it by downloading the latest version and replacing the existing binary.
You can download the latest version of the Resonate Server from the [Releases](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/releases).
