The Resonate TypeScript SDK supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for tracing task execution, retries, and remote procedure calls (RPCs).

Use the [@resonatehq/opentelemetry](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate-opentelemetry-ts) package.

This allows you to monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed function executions using your existing telemetry infrastructure.
All spans created by the SDK flow through your OpenTelemetry pipeline with parent-child relationships maintained across workers via the injected headers.
