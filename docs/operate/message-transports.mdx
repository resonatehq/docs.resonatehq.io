Resonate supports tranport plugins for message communication between Clients and Servers.

### Kafka server plugin

What does it do?

This plugin enables the server to put messages (containing task information) onto Kafka topics for consumption by SDK Clients using the SDK's Kafka transport plugin.

Where to find it?

The Kafka transport plugin is currently behind a build tag.
If your binary does not already include it, rebuild with the `kafka` (or `all`) build tag:

```shell
go build -tags kafka -o resonate
```

Enable the plugin at runtime with the Kafka flags:

```shell
./resonate serve --aio-kafka-enable \
  --aio-kafka-brokers localhost:9092 \
  --aio-kafka-timeout 30s
```

Or, config keys: `aio.plugins.kafka.enabled`, `aio.plugins.kafka.config`.

### Kafka SDK plugin

What does it do?

This plugin enables SDK Clients to consume messages from Kafka topics produced by the Resonate server's Kafka transport plugin.

Where to find it?

### SQS server plugin

What does it do?

This plugin enables the server to put messages (containing task information) onto AWS SQS queues for consumption by SDK Clients using the SDK's SQS transport plugin.

Where to find it?

This transport is behind a build tag.
If your binary does not already include it, rebuild with the `sqs`, `aws`, or `all` build tag:

```shell
go build -tags sqs -o resonate
```

Enable it with the SQS flags:

```shell
./resonate serve --aio-sqs-enable \
  --aio-sqs-timeout 30s \
  --aio-sqs-workers 1
```

Or, config keys: `aio.plugins.sqs.enabled`, `aio.plugins.sqs.config`.
