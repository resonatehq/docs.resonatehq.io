This page documents known errors that may be encountered when using Resonate and how to troubleshoot them.

If you believe your issue is not covered here, reach out in [Discord](https://resonatehq.io/discord) to discuss.

Known errors will likely have an error code associated with them and a short error message.

Troubleshooting steps are categorized by error code ranges:

- [Server request errors (40000-49999)](#server-request-errors)
- [Server errors (50000-59999)](#server-errors)
- [Python SDK errors (1000-1099)](#python-sdk-errors)
- [TypeScript SDK errors (1100-1199)](#typescript-sdk-errors)

## Server request errors

These are known errors you may encounter when making requests to the Resonate Server API.

**Range: 40000-49999**

Request errors signify problems with the request.
Generally, retrying the request will not resolve the issue.

**Error Schema**

When an error occurs, the response body will contain the following information.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 5002,
    "message": "failed to update promise",
    "details": [
      {
        "@type": "ServerError",
        "message": "attempt to write a readonly database",
        "domain": "server",
        "metadata": {
          "url": "https://docs.resonatehq.io/reference/error-codes#5002"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `code` field can be used to programmatically identify the error.
The message and details provide a human readable description of what went wrong.

The `details` provide structured diagnostic data such as the originating subsystem and links to documentation which can assist in debugging and troubleshooting.
