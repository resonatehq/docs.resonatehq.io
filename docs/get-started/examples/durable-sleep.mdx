## Problem

A business process may need to sleep for a period much longer than the typical lifetime of a process.

Since a process is more likely to crash the longer it is alive, and if a business process needs to suspend (or "sleep") for days, weeks, or even years, then developers are often forced to use cron jobs as a means to reawaken long-sleeping processes.

This leads to complexity that is hard to reason about, test, and rely on.

## Solution

Resonate enables developers to sleep directly in their workflows without leaving the process running idle, reducing implementation complexity while ensuring the business process can survive across process crashes.

## Quick example

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
    groupId="preferred-language"
    defaultValue="python"
    values={[
        {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
        {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},
    ]}>

    <TabItem value="python" >

```python
@resonate.register
def sleeping_workflow(ctx: Context, seconds: int):

    yield ctx.sleep(seconds)

    # ...
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript" >

```typescript
function* sleepingWorkflow(ctx: Context, milliseconds: number) {
  yield ctx.sleep(milliseconds);

  // ...
}

resonate.register("sleepingWorkflow", sleepingWorkflow);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
