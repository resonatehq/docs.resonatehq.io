Want to get started with Resonate?

We want you to have the best possible experience while getting started and using Resonate.

Therefore, what you do next really depends on where you are coming from and what you are trying to do.

If you have experience with either Temporal or DBOS you may want to review our "coming from x" guides:

- [Coming from Temporal](/evaluate/coming-from/temporal)
- [Coming from DBOS](/evaluate/coming-from/dbos)

{/* - [Coming from Restate](/evaluate/coming-from/restate) */}

{/* - [Coming from BYODE (Building Your Own Durable Execution)](/evaluate/coming-from/byode) */}

If you are trying to solve a specific problem, you may want to start with an [example application](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples) that aligns with your use case, and review the README for more information.

If you want to start a new project, either follow the [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) or get started with a [project template](/get-started/project-templates).

If you have an existing project, follow our guide on [integrating Resonate into an existing project](/get-started/existing-project).

If you want to get an in-depth understanding of how to use Resonate, follow our [tutorials](/learn).
