Want to get started with Resonate?

We want you to have the best possible experience while getting started and using Resonate.

Therefore, what you do next really depends on where you are coming from and what you are trying to do.

If you have experience with either Temporal, Restate, DBOS, or building your own reliable distributed system, you may want to review our "coming from x" guides:

- [Coming from Temporal](/evaluate/coming-from-temporal)
- [Coming from Restate](/evaluate/coming-from-restate)
- [Coming from DBOS](/evaluate/coming-from-dbos)
- [Coming from BYODE (Building Your Own Durable Execution)](/evaluate/building-your-own-durable-execution)

If you are trying to solve a specific problem, you may want to start with an [example application](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples) that aligns with your use case, and review the README for more information.

If you want to start a new project, follow our guide on [starting a new project](/get-started/new-project).

If you have an existing project, follow our guide on [integrating Resonate into an existing project](/get-started/existing-project).

If you want to get an in-depth understanding of how to use Resonate, follow our [tutorials](/learn).
