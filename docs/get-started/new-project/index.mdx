Looking to start a new project with Resonate?

We have curated several ways to help you get a new project up and running quickly.

There is a CLI built into the Resonate Server which can scaffold a new project from a template.

And there are also several example projects that you can clone and use as a starting point.

If you have questions about which template or example to use, please reach out on [Discord](https://resonatehq.io/discord).

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
