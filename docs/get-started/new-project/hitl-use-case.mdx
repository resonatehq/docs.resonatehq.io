## Problem

You want to build a system that requires human input at certain stages of the process, such as manual review or approval.

How do you suspend a business process until a human has completed a task, and then resume the process once the human has completed their task?

## Solution

Await on a Durable Promise to block the process.
Resolve the Promise once the human has completed their task.
