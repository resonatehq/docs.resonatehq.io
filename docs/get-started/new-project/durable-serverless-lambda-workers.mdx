description: Start a new project that runs a durable worker on AWS Lambda without losing in-flight progress.
---

Use Resonate to turn an AWS Lambda function into a reliable worker that spans cold starts and retries.

Python example coming soon.

import CloneRepoGrid from "@site/src/components/CloneRepoGrid/CloneRepoGrid";
import CloneRepoCard from "@site/src/components/CloneRepoCard/CloneRepoCard";

<CloneRepoGrid>
  <CloneRepoCard
    sdk="TypeScript SDK"
    description="Durable serverless Lambda worker project example"
    link="https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-durable-serverless-lambda-workers-ts"
  />
</CloneRepoGrid>

## Problem

Lambda functions are ephemeral and stateless, making it difficult to coordinate multi-step work or guarantee at-least-once completion when retries happen.

Orchestration services add cost and complexity, while homegrown state machines are brittle and hard to evolve.

## Solution

Resonate externalizes workflow state and retries so your Lambda handler can stay simple. Each invocation resumes a durable workflow, allowing you to fan out tasks, await remote systems, and recover automatically after AWS restarts your function.

The example project shows how to provision the Lambda, connect it to Resonate, and expose an API Gateway endpoint that feeds work into the workflow.

## Quick example

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
    groupId="preferred-language"
    defaultValue="typescript"
    values={[
        {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},
    ]}>

    <TabItem value="typescript" >

```typescript
import { resonate } from "@resonatehq/server";
import type { Context } from "@resonatehq/sdk";

export function* lambdaWorker(ctx: Context, task: TaskPayload) {
  const attempt = yield ctx.run(startExecution, task);

  const outcome = yield ctx.run(waitForDependency, attempt.id);

  yield ctx.run(finalizeTask, outcome);
}

resonate.register("lambdaWorker", lambdaWorker);
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
