## Problem

Imagine a worker process that pulls messages from a queue, performs the requested task, and then pushes a completion message to another queue.

Problem one: head-of-line blocking. If the first message kicks off a long operation—say, an hour—and the next one would only take 30 seconds, the shorter job gets stuck waiting. Unless the worker supports concurrency, this kills efficiency.

Problem two: crashes and repeat work. If a task involves multiple steps and the worker crashes halfway through, it may redo already-completed steps when it restarts, leading to duplicate work or unintended side effects.

The bottom line is a worker node sitting between two queues should do two things well:

Handle tasks concurrently to stay efficient.
Resume cleanly after crashes to stay reliable.

## Solution

Use Resonate to build a worker that can process messages concurrently and recover from crashes without repeating work.
