Welcome to Resonate's documentation!

## What is Resonate?

Resonate provides developers with a holistic programming model for building reliable and scalable cloud applications.

With Resonate you can develop reliable and scalable agentic systems, microservices, event-driven systems, data pipelines, long-running workflows, web services, backgrounds jobs, and more — But without stressing over crash recovery, function retries, idempotency guarantees, human-in-the-loop semantics, and other complexities that come with building distributed systems.

Resonate APIs are the quality of life improvements that developers have been yearning for.
