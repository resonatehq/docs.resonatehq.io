Resonate facilitates the development and operation of distributed applications.

## System architecture

There are two core components involved that enable Resonate to provide its unique benefits and it's important to understand the architecture of the system to understand how it works.

The following diagram illustrates the system architecture of Resonate:

### Resonate SDK

Developers use the Resonate SDK to build distributed applications with a simple, sequential programming model.
With it, they write functions that execute asynchronously across multiple processes or machines.

Each process that runs the Resonate SDK acts as a Worker, also called an Application Node.
A Resonate application can consist of as many Application Nodes as needed.
These nodes actively execute the application’s functions and coordinate their execution across the system.

Resonate offers SDKs for the following langauges:

- [Python](/develop/python)
- [TypeScript](/develop/typescript)

### Resonate Server

Each Application Node connects to a Resonate Server.
The Resonate Server acts as a supervisor and orchestrator by storing Durable Promises and sending messages to Application Nodes.

Resonate Servers can communication with each other, enabling a system to contain multiple Resonate Servers.
This prevents a star-like topology and enables a fully decentralized system.

## Durable Promises

The core developer facing primitive that developers need to work with, other than a function is the Durable Promise.

A Durable Promise represents a function invocation.
It is durable because it is stored in a database outside of the process that created it.

The Durable Promise contains the function invocation information and after the function returns, contains the result of the function.
By using unique identifiers for Durable Promises, Resonate can replay function executions using the results stored in Durable Promises, enabling recovery of a function execution should the process crash.

## Global Event Loop

The core underlying mechanism that all of the components play a role in is the Global Event Loop.
The Global Event Loop is responsible for passing messages between the processes and ensuring the recovery and the coordination of function executions across the system.

## Invocation locality

A Resonate SDK enables developers to invoke functions locally or remotely in an asynchronous manner.
That is — a developer can choose to invoke a function in the same process as the caller or in a different process without blocking the caller and await on the results when it suits them.

This enables developers to write sequential, procedure oriented code that is easy to understand and reason about.

The two core invocation types are:

- Local Function Invocation (LFI)
- Remote Function Invocation (RFI)

### Local Function Invocation

A Local Function Invocation (LFI) is the act of invoking a function (the callee) in the same process as the caller.

There are two benefits to using Resonate LFIs over regular function calls:

1. The callee is automatically retried if it returns an error.
2. The entire local Call Graph can recover and resume in another process if the first process crashes.

### Remote Function Invocation

A Remote Function Invocation (RFI), is the act of invoking a function (the callee) in a different process than the one the caller is in.

The major benefit to using Resonate RFIs over regular RPCs is that Resonate RFIs are asynchronous.
That is — if either the caller process, callee process, or both processes crash then the Call Graph can recover and resume in new processes.
