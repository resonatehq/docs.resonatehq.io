**Why adopt Resonate?**

Resonate is dead simple, formally modeled, and deterministically tested â€” the way software should be.

**Dead simple**

Dead simple is Resonate HQ's motto and what Resonate's developer experience aims to be.

While there is a lot of complexity in distributed systems, Resonate aims to push that complexity into the platform and provide a simple API for developers to build distributed, but durable, applications.

**Formally modeled**

Resonate is an implementation of the Distributed Async Await specification.

Distributed Async Await is an open specification that enables a sequential programming model in any language, while providing execution recovery with resume semantics (i.e. Durable Execution) for distributed applications.

The specification is formally modeled, meaning that it is based on formal methods and has been proven to be correct.

**Deterministically tested**

Resonate components have Deterministic Simulation Testing built in, to ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios.

## Developer experience
