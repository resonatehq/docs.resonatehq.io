Welcome to the Resonate Typescript SDK guide!
This SDK makes it possible to write Distributed Async Await applications with Typescript.
This guide covers installation and features that the SDK offers.

:::tip [API reference](https://resonatehq.github.io/resonate-sdk-ts/)

:::

## Installation

**How to install the Resonate Typescript SDK into your project.**

To install the Resonate Typescript SDK, you can use any of your favorite package managers.

### `npm`

```shell
npm install @resonatehq/sdk
```

### `yarn`

```shell
yarn add @resonatehq/sdk
```

## Initialization

**How to initialize Resonate in your Worker / Application Node.**

There are two ways to initialize Resonate, local and remote.

**Local initialization**

Local initialization means that Resonate uses local memory for promise storage.

This is ideal for getting started quickly or for integrating Resonate into an existing application without relying on dependencies.

The drawback is that you can't use Resonate's Async RPC or recover executions from process / worker crashes.

```typescript
import { Resonate } from "@resonate/sdk";

const resonate = Resonate.local()
```

:::differentiator Dead Simple incremental adoption

Temporal, Restate, and DBOS require a server or database to get started.

Resonate enables you to get started with a local worker that stores promises in memory, no server or database required.
This makes it easy to incrementally adopt Resonate into your existing Typescript application.

:::

**Remote initialization**

Remote initialization means that promises are stored remotely, and that the worker receives messages from a remote source.
This is how Resonate enables Async RPC for building distributed applications that are reliable and scalable.

The quickest way to get started with Remote initialization is for the worker to use Resonate's default Poller message transport to receive messages directly from a Resonate Server.

```typescript
import { Resonate } from "@resonate/sdk";

const resonate = Resonate.remote()

// or alternatively
const resonate = Resonate.remote({host:"https://my-resonate.com"})

```

Resonate workers can receive messages from many different transports, such as HTTP, RabbitMQ, RedPanda, etc...
The Poller is a great starting place as it will long-poll for messages from the Resonate Server without any additional setup.

## Registration

**How to register a function with Resonate in the Typescript SDK.**

Using the `register` method.

### `resonate.register()`

**Method**

```typescript
function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}

resonate.register('foo', foo);
```

## Ephemeral-to-Durable

**How to invoke a function in the ephemeral world with the Resonate Class.**

To move from the ephemeral world to the durable world you use the Resonate Class to invoke functions.

There are two methods that you can use `.run()` and `.rpc()`.

### `.run()`

Resonate's `.run()` method will invoke the function in the same process.
You can think of it as a "run right here" invocation.
After invocation, the function is considered durable and can recover in another process if desired.

**Decorated function invocation**

```typescript
function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}

const rfoo = resonate.register('foo', foo);

rfoo.run("foo")
```

**Method registered invocation**

```typescript
function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}g

resonate.register('foo', foo);

resonate.run("foo", foo)
```

### `.rpc()`

Resonate's `.rpc()` method (Remote Procedure Call) invokes the function in a remote process.

:::tip Remote initialization required

The RPC method requires that the Worker / Application Node is connected with a Resonate Server.
It also assumes that the Worker / Application Node where the invoked function is running is also connected to a Resonate Server and can receive messages.

:::

You can think of this API as a "run somewhere else" invocation (Asynchronous Remote Procedure Call).
However, if the function is registered locally, it is still possible for the function to execute in the same process.
After invocation, the function is considered durable and can recover in another process if desired.

The invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on at any point after.

**process a**

```typescript
// process b
const resonate = Resonate.remote({group: "group-a"})

function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}

resonate.register('foo', foo);
```

**process b**

```typescript
// process b
const resonate = Resonate.remote({group: "group-b"})

// invoke function foo from process b on process a
resonate.rpc("invocation-id", "foo", args, resonate.options({target:"poll://any@group-a"}))
```

### `.setDependency()`

Resonate's `.setDependency()` method is not implement set for the Typescript SDK

### `.promises.create()`

Resonate's `.promise.create()` method is not exposed yet

### `.promises.get()`

Resonate's `.promise.get()` method is not exposed yet

### `.promises.resolve()`

Resonate's `.promise.resolve()` method is not exposed yet

### `.promises.reject()`

Resonate's `.promise.reject()` method is not exposed yet


## Durable

**How to use the Resonate Context object in the Typescript SDK.**

Resonate's Context object enables you to invoke functions from inside a Durable Function.
This is how you extend the Call Graph and create a world of Durable Functions.
Inside a Durable Function you use the `yield` keyword to interact with the Context object.

### `.lfi()` or alias `.beginRun()`

Context's `.lfi()` method (Local Function Invocation) invokes a function in the **same process** in an **asynchronous manner**.
That is — the invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on at any point after.

```typescript
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  const promise = yield ctx.beginRun(bar, args)
  const value = yield promise
  return value
}


function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  return
}

```

### `.lfc()` or alias `.run()`

Context's `.lfc()` method (Local Function Call) invokes a function in the **same process** in a **synchronous manner**.
That is — the calling function blocks until the invoked function returns.

```typescript
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  const value = yield ctx.run(bar, args)
  return value
}


function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  return
}
```

### `.rfi()` or alias `.beginRpc()`

Context's `.rfi()` method (Remote Function Invocation) invokes a function in a **remote process** in an **asynchronous manner**.
That is — the invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on at any point after.

**process a**

```typescript
// process a
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  const promise = yield ctx.beginRpc(bar, args, ctx.options({target:"poll://any@group-b"}))
  const value = yield promise
  return value
}

resonate.register("foo", foo)
```

**process b**

```typescript
// process b
function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  return
}

resonate.register("bar", bar)
```

### `.rfc()` or alias `.rpc()`

Context's `.rfc()` method (Remote Function Call) invokes a function in a **remote process** in a **synchronous manner**.
That is — the calling function blocks until the invoked function returns.

**process a**

```typescript
// process a
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  const value = yield ctx.rpc(bar, args, ctx.options({target:"poll://any@group-b"}))
  return value
}
resonate.register("foo", foo)
```

**process b**

```typescript
function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  return
}

resonate.register("bar", bar)
```

### `.getDependency()`

Context's `.getDependency()` method is not implemented yet

### `.sleep()`

Context's `.sleep()` method is not implemented yet.

### `.promise()`

Context's `.promise()` method is not implemented yet.

### `.options()`

Many of Context's methods support options on the call you are making. But you pass them as the final argument when doing the call

```typescript

function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  const promise = yield ctx.beginRpc(bar, args, ctx.options(...))
  const value = promise
  return value
}

resonate.run("foo", foo, args, resonate.options(...))
````
