## Initialization

**How to initialize a Resonate Client.**

You will need to initialize a Resonate Client in each process that you want to use Resonate in.

:::differentiator Zero-dependency development

Your Resonate Client does not need to connect to a Resonate Server to get started.
You can use the Resonate Client in "local mode", working with functions that are local to the process.

This is in contrast to Temporal, Restate, and DBOS whichrequire a server or database to get started.

:::

There are two ways to initialize Resonate, local and remote.

**Local initialization**

Local initialization means that Resonate uses local memory for promise storage.
This is ideal for getting started quickly or for integrating Resonate into an existing application without relying on dependencies.
However, just remember that you can't use Resonate's Async RPC or recover executions from process / worker crashes in local mode.

```typescript
import { Resonate } from "@resonate/sdk";

const resonate = Resonate.local();
```

**Remote initialization**

Remote initialization means that promises are stored remotely, and that the worker receives messages from a remote source.
This is how Resonate enables Async RPC for building distributed applications that are reliable and scalable.

When you initialize Resonate in remote mode, you need to specify the group that the process is a part of.
By default, the client will try to connect to a local Resonate Server running on `http://localhost:8001`.

```typescript
import { Resonate } from "@resonate/sdk";

const resonate = Resonate.remote({
  group: "<group-name>",
});

// If you need to specify a different Resonate Server
const resonate = Resonate.remote({
  host: "https://my-resonate.com",
  group: "<group-name>",
});
```

{/* Resonate workers can receive messages from many different transports, such as HTTP, RabbitMQ, RedPanda, etc... */}

{/* The Poller is a great starting place as it will long-poll for messages from the Resonate Server without any additional setup. */}

## Registration

**How to register a function with Resonate in the Typescript SDK.**

After you have initialized Resonate, you can register functions with it.

If Resonate is initialized in local mode, the registered functions are only available in that process.
However, if Resonate is initialized in remote mode, then the registered functions become available to any process that is connected to the same Resonate Server.

Using the `.register()` method is the only way to register a function with the TypeScript SDK.

### `resonate.register()`

**Method**

```typescript
function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}

resonate.register("foo", foo);

// OR

rFoo = resonate.register("foo", foo);
```

## Dependency injection

Use the `.setDependency()` method to set dependencies for your functions. If you have a database connection, a client object, custom logger, or other dependency that you want your functions to have access to, you can use this method to make it available.

### `.setDependency()`

Resonate's `.setDependency()` method is not implemented yet for the Typescript SDK

## Client APIs | Ephemeral-to-Durable

:::tip Ephemeral vs Durable

In the context of Resonate, we use the term "ephemeral" for functions that do not automatically recover and resume after a process crash.
Whereas, the term "durable" is used for functions that do.

You can think of Ephmeral-to-Durable APIs as Resonate Client APIs.
That is — these are the APIs that are used at the edge of your application.

:::

**How to invoke a function in the ephemeral world with the Resonate Class.**

To move from the ephemeral world to the durable world you use the Resonate Class to invoke functions.

There are two methods that you can use `.run()` and `.rpc()`.

### `.run()`

Resonate's `.run()` method will invoke the function in the same process.
You can think of it as a "run right here" invocation.
After invocation, the function is considered durable and can recover in another process if desired.

**Decorated function invocation**

```typescript
function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}

const rfoo = resonate.register("foo", foo);

rfoo.run("foo");
```

**Method registered invocation**

```typescript
function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}
g;

resonate.register("foo", foo);

resonate.run("foo", foo);
```

### `.rpc()`

Resonate's `.rpc()` method (Remote Procedure Call) invokes the function in a remote process.

:::tip Remote initialization required

The RPC method requires that the Worker / Application Node is connected with a Resonate Server.
It also assumes that the Worker / Application Node where the invoked function is running is also connected to a Resonate Server and can receive messages.

:::

You can think of this API as a "run somewhere else" invocation (Asynchronous Remote Procedure Call).
However, if the function is registered locally, it is still possible for the function to execute in the same process.
After invocation, the function is considered durable and can recover in another process if desired.

The invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on at any point after.

**process a**

```typescript
// process b
const resonate = Resonate.remote({ group: "group-a" });

function foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  // ...
  return result;
}

resonate.register("foo", foo);
```

**process b**

```typescript
// process b
const resonate = Resonate.remote({ group: "group-b" });

// invoke function foo from process b on process a
resonate.rpc(
  "invocation-id",
  "foo",
  args,
  resonate.options({ target: "poll://any@group-a" })
);
```

## Function APIs | Durable-to-Durable

**How to use the Resonate Context object in the Typescript SDK.**

Resonate's Context object enables you to invoke functions from inside a Durable Function.
This is how you extend the Call Graph and create a world of Durable Functions.
Inside a Durable Function you use the `yield` keyword to interact with the Context object.

### `.run()`

Context's `.lfc()` method (Local Function Call) invokes a function in the **same process** in a **synchronous manner**.
That is — the calling function blocks until the invoked function returns.

```typescript
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  const value = yield ctx.run(bar, args);
  return value;
}

function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  return;
}
```

### `.beginRun()`

Context's `.lfi()` method (Local Function Invocation) invokes a function in the **same process** in an **asynchronous manner**.
That is — the invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on at any point after.

```typescript
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  const promise = yield ctx.beginRun(bar, args);
  const value = yield promise;
  return value;
}

function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  return;
}
```

### `.rpc()`

Context's `.rfc()` method (Remote Function Call) invokes a function in a **remote process** in a **synchronous manner**.
That is — the calling function blocks until the invoked function returns.

**process a**

```typescript
// process a
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  const value = yield ctx.rpc(
    bar,
    args,
    ctx.options({ target: "poll://any@group-b" })
  );
  return value;
}
resonate.register("foo", foo);
```

**process b**

```typescript
function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  return;
}

resonate.register("bar", bar);
```

### `.beginRpc()`

Context's `.rfi()` method (Remote Function Invocation) invokes a function in a **remote process** in an **asynchronous manner**.
That is — the invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on at any point after.

**process a**

```typescript
// process a
function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  const promise = yield ctx.beginRpc(
    bar,
    args,
    ctx.options({ target: "poll://any@group-b" })
  );
  const value = yield promise;
  return value;
}

resonate.register("foo", foo);
```

**process b**

```typescript
// process b
function bar(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any {
  return;
}

resonate.register("bar", bar);
```

### `.getDependency()`

Context's `.getDependency()` method is not implemented yet

### `.sleep()`

Context's `.sleep()` method is not implemented yet.

### `.promise()`

Context's `.promise()` method is not implemented yet.

### `.options()`

Many of Context's methods support options on the call you are making. But you pass them as the final argument when doing the call

```typescript

function* foo(ctx: Context, ...args: any): any{
  const promise = yield ctx.beginRpc(bar, args, ctx.options(...))
  const value = promise
  return value
}

resonate.run("foo", foo, args, resonate.options(...))
```
