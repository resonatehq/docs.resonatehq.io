## Initialization

**How to initialize a Resonate Client.**

There are two ways to initialize Resonate, local and remote.

**Local initialization**

Local initialization means that Resonate uses local memory for promise storage.

This is ideal for getting started quickly or for integrating Resonate into an existing application without relying on dependencies.

The drawback is that you can't use Resonate's Async RPC or recover executions from process / worker crashes.

```python
from resonate import Resonate

resonate = Resonate()

# or alternatively
resonate = Resonate.local()
```

:::differentiator Dead Simple incremental adoption

Temporal, Restate, and DBOS require a server or database to get started.

Resonate enables you to get started with a local worker that stores promises in memory, no server or database required.
This makes it easy to incrementally adopt Resonate into your existing Python application.
:::

**Remote initialization**

Remote initialization means that promises are stored remotely, and that the worker receives messages from a remote source.
This is how Resonate enables Async RPC for building distributed applications that are reliable and scalable.

The quickest way to get started with Remote initialization is for the worker to use Resonate's default Poller message transport to receive messages directly from a Resonate Server.

```python
from resonate import Resonate

resonate = Resonate.remote()

# or alternatively
resonate = Resonate.remote(host="https://my-resonate.com")
```

Resonate workers can receive messages from many different transports, such as HTTP, RabbitMQ, RedPanda, etc...
The Poller is a great starting place as it will long-poll for messages from the Resonate Server without any additional setup.

## Resonate APIs

Registration

**How to register a function with Resonate in the Python SDK.**

There are two ways to register a function with Resonate: using the `register()` method or using the `@resonate.register` decorator.

### `@resonate.register`

**Decorator**

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    return result
```

### `.register()`

**Method**

```python
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    return result

resonate.register(foo)
```

**How to invoke a function in the ephemeral world with the Resonate Class.**

To move from the ephemeral world to the durable world you use the Resonate Class to invoke functions.

There are two methods that you can use: `.run()` and `.rpc()`.

### `.run()`

Resonate's `.run()` method invokes a function in the same process and returns the result.
You can think of it as a "run right here" invocation.
After invocation, the function is considered durable and will recover in another process if required.

```python
result = resonate.run("invocation-id", foo, arg)
```

### `.begin_run()`

Similar to `.run()` but instead of returning the result, returns a handle so the result can be awaited later.

```python
handle = resonate.begin_run("invocation-id", foo, arg)
result = handle.result()
```

### `.rpc()`

Resonate's `.rpc()` method (Remote Procedure Call) invokes a function in a remote process and returns the result.
You can think of it as a "run somewhere else" invocation (Asynchronous Remote Procedure Call).
After invocation, the function is considered durable and will recover in another process if required.

```python
result = resonate.rpc("invocation-id", "foo", args)

# optionally target a specific group
result = resonate.options(target="workers").rpc("invocation-id", "foo", args)
```

### `.begin_rpc()`

Similar to `.rpc()` but instead of returning the result, returns a handle so the result can be awaited later.

```python
handle = resonate.begin_rpc("invocation-id", "foo", arg)
result = handle.result()
```

### `.set_dependency()`

Resonate's `.set_dependency()` method allows you to set a dependency for the Application Node.
You can then access the dependency in the function using the [`.get_dependency()`](#get_dependency) method.

Dependencies can only be added in the ephemeral world.

```python
resonate.set_dependency("dependency-name", dependency)
```

The dependency can be accessed from any function in the Call Graph on that Application Node.
This is useful for things like database connections or other resources that you want to share across functions.

### `.promises.create()`

Resonate's `.promises.create()` method allows you to create a promise.

```python
resonate.promises.create(
    id="promise-id",
    timeout=int(time.time() * 1000) + 30000,  # 30s in the future
)
```

### `.promises.get()`

Resonate's `.promises.get()` method allows you to get a promise by ID.

```python
resonate.promises.get("promise-id")
```

### `.promises.resolve()`

Resonate's `.promises.resolve()` method allows you to resolve a promise by ID.

This is useful for HITL use cases where you want to wait for a human to approve or reject a function execution.
It works well in conjunction with the [`.promise()`](#promise) method.

```python
resonate.promises.resolve(
    id="promise-id",
    data=json.dumps({}),  # optional
)
```

### `.promises.reject()`

Resonate's `.promises.reject()` method allows you to reject a promise by ID.

```python
resonate.promises.reject(
    id="promise-id",
    data=json.dumps({}),  # optional
)
```

### `.options()`

Many of Resonate's methods support options on the call you are making.

## Context APIs

**How to use the Resonate Context object in the Python SDK.**

Resonate's Context object enables you to invoke functions from inside a Durable Function.
This is how you extend the Call Graph and create a world of Durable Functions.
Inside a Durable Function you use the `yield` keyword to interact with the Context object.

### `.run()`

Context's `.run()` method invokes a function in the **same process** in a **synchronous manner**.
That is — the calling function blocks until the invoked function returns.

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    result = yield ctx.run(bar, arg)
    # do more stuff
    # ...


def bar(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    return
```

### `.begin_run()`

Context's `.begin_run()` method invokes a function in the **same process** in an **asynchronous manner**.
That is — the invocation returns a promise which can be awaited later.

```py
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    promise = yield ctx.begin_run(bar, arg)
    # do more sture
    result = yield promise
    # ...


def bar(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    return
```

### `.rpc()`

Context's `.rpc()` method invokes a function in a **remote process** in a **synchronous manner**.
That is — the calling function blocks until the invoked function returns.

```py
# process a
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    result = yield ctx.rpc("bar", arg)
    # do more stuff
    # ...

# process b
@resonate.register
def bar(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    return
```

### `.begin_rpc()`

Context's `.begin_rpc()` method invokes a function in a **remote process** in an **asynchronous manner**.
That is — the invocation returns a promise which can be awaited on later.

```python
# process a
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    promise = yield ctx.begin_rpc("bar", arg)
    # do more stuff
    result = yield promise
    # ...

# process b
@resonate.register
def bar(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    return
```

### `.get_dependency()`

Context's `.get_dependency()` method allows you to get a dependency that was set in the ephemeral world using the [`.set_dependency()`](#set_dependency) method and use it the Durable World.

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    dependency = ctx.get_dependency("dependency-name")
    # do something with the dependency
    # ...
```

### `.sleep()`

Context's `.sleep()` method allows you to sleep inside a function.
There is no limit to how long you can sleep.
The sleep method accepts a float value in seconds.

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    yield ctx.sleep(5.0)
    # do more stuff
    # ...
```

### `.promise()`

Context's `.promise()` method allows you to get or create a promise that can be awaited on.

If no ID is provided, one is generated and a new promise is created.
If an ID is provided and a promise already exists with that ID, then the existing promise is returned (if the idempotency keys match).

This is very useful for HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) use cases where you want to block progress until a human has taken an action or provided data.
It works well in conjunction with the [`.promises.resolve()`](#promisesresolve) method.

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    promise = yield ctx.promise(id="promise-id")
    # do more stuff
    result = yield promise
    # ...
```

You can also pass custom data into the promise.

- In a Pending state, custom data stores in the `param` field of the promise.
- In a Resolved state the custom data stores in the `result` field of the promise.
- In a Rejected state the custom data stores in the `result` field of the promise.

```python
@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, arg):
    # ...
    promise = yield ctx.promise(data={"key": "value"})
    # do more stuff
    result = yield promise
    # ...
```

### `.options()`

Many of Context's methods support options on the call you are making.
