In this tutorial, you’ll build a website summarization AI agent using the Resonate Python SDK, Flask, and Ollama.

By doing so, you’ll gain experience with Resonate’s implementation of the **Distributed Async Await** programming model and the core features of the Python SDK.

This tutorial follows the philosophy of _progressive disclosure_ and is broken into several parts, starting with a simple example and building on it step by step.
Each part introduces new concepts.
You can choose to stop at the end of any part of the tutorial and still have a working application.

:::tip Final example application

Want to jump straight to working with the final example application?
[example-website-summarization-agent-py](https://github.com/resonatehq-examples/example-website-summarization-agent-py) repository.

:::

In part 1, you will start with a single Worker and observe the SDK's ability to automatically retry application-level failures (failed function executions).

:::tip What is a Worker?

A Worker is a process that runs your application code (i.e. executes functions).
This is similar to the concept of a "worker" or "worker node" in other Durable Execution platforms like Temporal, Restate, and DBOS.

:::

Then in part 2 you will connect your Worker to a Resonate Server to enable recovery from platform-level failures and see how a function execution can recover from a process crash (Durable Execution).

In part 3 you will convert the invocation of the function on the Worker to an asynchronous Remote Procedure Call (Async RPC).
After, in part 4 you will add a third step to your workflow that blocks the execution on input from a human-in-the-loop and unblock it from another process.
Finally, in part 5 you will integrate a webscraper, such as Beautiful Soup, and an LLM, such as Ollama, to bring your application to life.

By the end of this tutorial you'll have a good understanding of the Resonate Python SDK and how to build Distributed Async Await applications with it.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a package manager installed.

This tutorial recommends using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the package manager.

This tutorial was written and tested with Resonate Server v0.7.9 and Resonate Python SDK v0.5.6.

Part 5 of this tutorial assumes you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and model "llama3.1" running locally on your machine.

## Automatic function retries

In this part of the tutorial you'll create a worker that is error prone to see how Resonate automatically retries failed function executions.

Start by scaffolding a new project.

First, install the CLI:

```shell
brew install resonatehq/tap/resonate
```

Navigate to the directory you want to scaffold your project in and run the following command:

```shell
resonate project create --name summarization-agent --template lfi-workflow-py
```

:::differentiator LFI = Local Function Invocation

The template you are using does not require a Resonate Server to run.
All function invocations are local, meaning they run in the same process as the worker, and store promises in memory.

Other "Durable Execution" platforms, such as Temporal, Restate, and DBOS, require your worker to connect to a server or database to get started.
This is not the case with Resonate.

:::

You should now have a directory called “summarization-agent” with the following structure:

```text
summarization-agent
    - src/
        - app.py
    - pyproject.toml
```

The app.py file should contain the following code:

```python
from resonate import Resonate

resonate = Resonate.local()


@resonate.register
def foo(ctx, greeting):
    print("running foo")
    greeting = yield ctx.lfc(bar, greeting)
    greeting = yield ctx.lfc(baz, greeting)
    return greeting


def bar(_, v):
    print("running bar")
    return f"{v} world"


def baz(_, v):
    print("running baz")
    return f"{v}!"


def main():
    try:
        handle = foo.run("hello-world-greeting", greeting="hello")
        print(handle.result())
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this template, `foo()` takes a string argument, greeting, and passes it first to `bar()` and then to `baz()`, each step concatenating to the string.
The greeting is then returned back to the caller and printed.

The `@resonate.register` decorator registers `foo()` with the Resonate instance enabling its invocation with a the `.run()` method.

The handle variable is a promise.
Calling `handle.result()` blocks progress of `main()` until `foo()` returns a result.

Both `bar()` and `baz()` are invoked using the Resonate Context’s LFC API (Local Function Call API), giving Resonate control over the invocation and execution of those functions.

Next, move into the root of the project and run the following commands to execute the app as-is:

```shell
uv sync
uv run app
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
running foo
running bar
running baz
hello world!
```

Let's update the function names to better reflect the purpose of the use case.

Update the `foo()`, `bar()`, and `baz()` function names to `download_and_summarize()`, `download()`, and `summarize()` respectively.
And, instead of passing a greeting, let's pass a URL of a website to download and summarize.

```python
@resonate.register
def download_and_summarize(ctx, url):
    print("running download_and_summarize")
    content = yield ctx.lfc(download, url)
    summary = yield ctx.lfc(summarize, content)
    return summary

def download(_, url):
    print("running download")
    return f"content of {url}"


def summarize(_, content):
    print("running summarize")
    return f"summary of {content}"


def main():
    try:
        url = "https://example.com"
        handle = download_and_summarize.run(url, url=url)
        print(handle.result())
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

Now, lets add some code to steps `download()` and `summarize()` so they fail 50% of the time.

First, import the random package into the app.

```python
# ...
import random
```

Then, in each of the step functions, `download()` and `summarize()`, directly after the print statements, randomly generate a number between 0 and 100 and raise an exception if the number is greater than 50.

```python
#...
import random

#...

def download(_, url):
    print("running download")
    if random.randint(0, 100) > 50:
        raise Exception("download encountered an error")
    return f"content of {url}"


def summarize(_, content):
    print("running summarize")
    if random.randint(0, 100) > 50:
        raise Exception("summarize encountered an error")
    return f"summary of {content}"
```

Now, each time you run the app, both `download()` and `summarize()` have a 50% chance of raising an exception.

**Without Resonate**, raised exceptions would stop the execution and no more progress would be made.

Consider if the app was written without Resonate, like this:

```python
def download_and_summarize(url):
    print("running download_and_summarize")
    content = download(url)
    summary = summarize(content)
    return summary


def download(_, url):
    print("running download")
    if random.randint(0, 100) > 50:
        raise Exception("download encountered an error")
    return f"content of {url}"


def summarize(_, content):
    print("running summarize")
    if random.randint(0, 100) > 50:
        raise Exception("summarize encountered an error")
    return f"summary of {content}"


def main():
    try:
        summary = download_and_summarize("https://example.com")
        print(summary)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If either `download()` or `summarize()` raise the exception, the execution of `download_and_summarize()` stops at the raised exception, `main()` prints the error, and that’s that.

**With Resonate** you will notice that even if there is a raised exception, the function retries until it succeeds, enabling `download_and_summarize()` to complete and return the summary.

Run your app several times until you encounter an error, and then wait and watch.

You should eventually see something like this:

```shell
running download_and_summarize
running download
[2025-07-18 09:41:54] [WARNING] [https://example.com] [https://example.com.1] Function download('https://example.com') failed with Exception('download encountered an error') (retrying in 2.0s)
running download
running summarize
[2025-07-18 09:41:56] [WARNING] [https://example.com] [https://example.com.2] Function summarize('content of https://example.com') failed with Exception('summarize encountered an error') (retrying in 2.0s)
running summarize
summary of content of https://example.com!
```

You will notice that if an exception is thrown, Resonate automatically retries executing the function.

**Congratulations! You have just witnessed Resonate's automatic function retries in action!**

By default, this will happen forever until the execution succeeds.

We say, “by default”, because this behaviour is configurable.
You can adjust the backoff interval (time between retries), maximum attempts, and which errors cause retries and which do not.
For example, here we adjust the Retry Policy of the invocation of bar to be “linear”:

```python
#...
from resonate.retry_policies import Linear
# ...

    content = yield ctx.lfc(download, url).options(
        retry_policy=Linear(delay=1, max_attempts=10)
    )
```

The Retry Policy in the previous code example sets the initial delay to 1 second, with a linear increase of the delay up to maximum of 10 attempts.

Later in the tutorial we will customize our Retry Policy to ignore certain application-level errors that we know shouldn’t be retried.

:::tip Application-level vs Platform-level failures

Application-level failures as errors that occur during the execution of a function, such as a raised exception in `download()` or `summarize()`.
These are errors related to use case logic.

Platform-level failures are errors that occur at the platform level, such as a process crash, a network failure, or issues with Resonate itself.

:::

The previous part of the tutorial showcased Resonate’s ability to automatically Retry function executions when an exception is raised, and runs the top-level function to completion.

But what if the process / worker crashes altogether in the middle of the execution?

In the next part of the tutorial, we will connect the worker to a Resonate Server to enable Recovery!

## Crash recovery

In this part of the tutorial you’ll connect your worker to a Resonate Server to enable recovery process crashes (platform-level failures), effectively providing "Durable Execution".
The Resonate Server acts as a supervisor and orchestrator for your worker, storing promises and sending messages.

Run the following command in a separate terminal to start the Resonate Server:

```shell
resonate serve
```

After the server is running, update your worker code.

There are two code updates you need to make for this part of the tutorial.

1. Change the Local Store to a Remote Store so that the worker can recover from a process crash.
2. Add a 10 second sleep to between the workflow steps so you have time to simulate a process crash.

First, instantiate Resonate in your worker with a Remote Store instead of a Local Store.

In Part 1, the template you used to scaffold your worker used a Local Store (in-process memory).

```python
# Create a Resonate instance with a local store
resonate = Resonate.local()
```

Update the worker to use a remote store.

```python
# Create a Resonate instance connected to the Resonate Server
resonate = Resonate.remote()
```

:::tip Default Remote Store Configuration

When you instantiate an instance of Resonate that connects to a remote store, the default connection settings will connect to a Resonate Server running on `http://localhost:8001`.
Additionally, your worker will connect to the Resonate Server with a long poll connection to to receive messages, (messages contain tasks that tell the worker what to do next).

:::

Next, add a 10 second sleep to `download_and_summarize()` between the `download()` and `summarize()` steps.
You don't need to import anything to do this.
You can use the `sleep()` API provided by Resonate Context.

```python
@resonate.register
def download_and_summarize(ctx, url):
    print("running download_and_summarize")
    content = yield ctx.lfc(download, url)
    # highlight-next-line
    yield ctx.sleep(10)
    summary = yield ctx.lfc(summarize, content)
    return summary
```

Now try running your worker again.

```shell
uv run app
```

You will see the following logs:

```
running download_and_summarize
running download
```

After you see the log "running download", kill the process.

It doesn't matter how long you wait, but when you are ready to continue, restart the worker.

```shell
uv run app
```

Remember, each step is still going to fail 50% of the time, so you may see errors.
But besides the errors, you should see the following logs:

```shell
running download_and_summarize
running summarize
summary of content of https://example.com!
```

Notice that you don't see the log "running download" after retarting the worker?
That's because the Resonate Server stored the result of `download()` in a promise.
When you restarted the worker after the crash, `download_and_summarize()` re-executed and the result of `download()` was retrieved from the promise.

**Congratulations, you have just witnessed Durable Execution in action!**

Don't change anything in the code and run the worker again.

This time the only log you should see is the following:

```shell
summary of content of https://example.com!
```

That's because the Resonate Server stored the result of `download_and_summarize()` in a promise.

If you look at the code where we invoke `download_and_summarize()`, you'll notice that we are using the url as the promise ID.

```python

# ...

    url = "https://example.com"
    # the first parameter is the promise ID
    handle = download_and_summarize.run(url, url=url)

    # ...
```

You can inspect the promise ID in the Resonate Server using the Resonate CLI.

```shell
resonate promise get https://example.com
```

You should see something like this:

```shell
Id:       https://example.com
State:    RESOLVED
Timeout:  1784400650144

Idempotency Key (create):    https://example.com
Idempotency Key (complete):  https://example.com

Param:
  Headers:
    resonate:format-py:  {"func": "download_and_summarize", "args": {"py/tuple": ["https://example.com"]}, "kwargs": {}, "version": 1}
  Data:
    {"func": "download_and_summarize", "args": ["https://example.com"], "kwargs": {}, "version": 1}

Value:
  Headers:
    resonate:format-py:  "summary of content of https://example.com!"
  Data:
    "summary of content of https://example.com!"

Tags:
  resonate:invoke:  poll://any@worker
  resonate:parent:  https://example.com
  resonate:root:    https://example.com
  resonate:scope:   global
```

Promise IDs are unique identifiers in a Resonate Application, and you must specify the promise ID for top-level invocations.
The promise IDs of `download()` and `summarize()` are generated automatically by default (you can turn off idempotency, or customize the promise IDs) and Resonate will know not to re-invoke those functions if `download_and_summarize()` is invoked again with the same promise ID.

If you are using the local store, the promise ID persists only as long as the process is alive.
If you are using a remote promise store (Resonate Server), the promise ID persists indefinitely.

Change the promise ID to something else and run the worker again.

```python
# ...
    url="https://resonatehq.io"
    handle = download_and_summarize.run(url, url=url)

    # ...
```

You will see that download_and_summarize() executes again from the top.

In the next part of the tutorial, you switch from using `resonate.run()` to using `resonate.rpc()` and asyncronously invoke download_and_summarize() via an RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

## Asynchronous RPC

In this part of the tutorial, you will move the code that invokes `download_and_summarize()` to a separate process.

Currently the code that invokes `download_and_summarize()` lives in the same file and process as `download_and_summarize()` and the other steps.

It looks like this:

```python
def main():
    try:
        url = "https://example.com"
        handle = download_and_summarize.run(url, url=url)
        print(handle.result())
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

The `.run()` method means "run this function right here".

You will move the invocation of `download_and_summarize()` to a separate process and use Resonate's `.rpc()` method to invoke it.
The `.rpc()` method means "invoke this function over there".

Start by creating a new file `invoke.py` in the `src` directory and add the following code:

```python
from resonate import Resonate

resonate = Resonate.remote(
    group="invoke",
)

def main():
    try:
        url= "https://example.com"
        handle = resonate.options(target="poll://any@worker").rpc(url, "download_and_summarize", url)
        print(handle.result())
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the previous code example, you are creating a new instance of Resonate that connects to the Resonate Server, identifying itself as a worker in the "invoke" group.
Additionally, you are invoking `foo()` using the `.rpc()` method instead of the `.run()` method.

A very important aspect of this change to the invocation is the `target` parameter in the `.options()` method.
This is how we instruct the Resonate Server where to send messages related to this invocation.

The `target` parameter is set to `poll://any@worker`, which means "send messages via the poller transport plugin to any worker that is part of the 'worker' group".

:::tip

If you are familiar with Temporal, then you are familiar with using task queue names to route tasks to specific workers.

With Temporal, the caller has limited control over which worker picks up the task, and how — That is, the caller can only specify a task queue name and workers can only long poll the Temporal Server for tasks.

Resonate's targeting capability supports specifying the message transport as well as unicast vs anycast and anycast with preference: `<transport-plugin>://<any | uni>@<group>/<id>`.

:::

Next you need to apply two updates to `app.py`:

1. Update the instantiation of the Resonate instance to identify it as part of the `worker` group.

```python
resonate = Resonate.remote(
    group="worker",
)
```

2. Remove the invocation of `download_and_summarize()` in `main()` and replace it with `resonate.start()` to explicitly start Resonate worker threads and `Event().wait()` to keep the worker alive and waiting on messages.

```python
from threading import Event

# ...

def main():
    resonate.start()
    Event().wait()
```

Now you will run the worker and invoke script separately.

In one terminal, run the worker:

```shell
uv run app
```

In another terminal, run the invoke script:

```shell
uv run src/invoke.py
```

:::tip Pass a unique promise ID

Remember to update the promise ID in the invoke script to something unique (use a different website url), such as `https://distributed-async-await.io`, so that the invocation does not return the value from the already completed promise with same ID.

If you are familiar with Temporal, then you will expect to invoke new function executions with the same ID and adjust a Workflow Reuse Policy to reject duplicate invocations with the same ID.

Resonate correlates IDs with return values.
So you must provide a unique ID if you want to invoke a new execution that results in a new value.

:::

You should see the logs in the worker terminal and eventually the result printed in the invoke script terminal.

**Congratulations! You have just invoked a function in a different process using Resonate's Async RPC API!**

From here, you can see how Resonate handles leader election and load balancing across multiple workers, by running multiple workers in the same group.

For example, if you generate a random promise ID in the invoke script, you can run multiple instances of the invoke script and see how Resonate distributes the invocations across the workers in the `worker` group.

```python
import uuid
# ...

def main():
    handles = []
    for _ in range(5):
        promise_id = f"{str(uuid.uuid4())}"
        handle = resonate
            .options(target="poll://any@worker")
            .rpc(promise_id, "download_and_summarize", "https://example.com")
        handles.append(handle)
    for handle in handles:
        print(handle.result())
```

Next, you will block the execution of the `download_and_summarize()` workflow on input from a human-in-the-loop.

## Human-in-the-loop

In this part of the tutorial, you will add a step to the workflow that blocks the execution on input from a human-in-the-loop.
Resonate enables you to create and wait on a promise, blocking progress until the promise resolves.
So far, you have created promises attached to function executions.
But you can also create a promise that is resolved by an external process, such as a human-in-the-loop.

Let's apply two updates to the worker (`app.py`):

1. Block the workflow on input from a human-in-the-loop after the summarization step.
2. Add a While loop that breaks depending on the input from the human-in-the-loop.
3. (Optional) Remove the sleep between steps to focus on the human-in-the-loop aspect of the workflow.

```python
@resonate.register
def download_and_summarize(ctx, url):
    print("running download_and_summarize")
    content = yield ctx.lfc(download, url)
    while True:
        summary = yield ctx.lfc(summarize, content)
        promise = yield ctx.promise()

        print(promise.id)

        confirmed = yield promise
        if confirmed:
            break

    return summary
```

In the previous code example, we create a promise using `ctx.promise()`, print the ID of the promise (so we can use the ID to resolve it from another process), and then wait for the promise to be resolved using `yield promise`.

We can also pass data to the workflow through the resolution of the promise, in this case it will be a boolean value indicating whether to run the summarization step again or not.
Confirmed means the summarization was accepted and we can move on to the next step.

Restart your worker.

And, update your invocation script to provide a new URL and run the script again.

You will see the summarization step run and then the ID of the promise printed in the logs.
Then the workflow will block on the resolution of the promise (you won't get the result back to the invocation script yet).

So, now we can resolve the promise using the Python SDK or with the CLI.
For now, let's resolve the promise with the CLI.

Copy the promise ID printed in the logs.
It should be something like `https://example.com.3`.

Open a new terminal and run the following command to resolve the promise:

```shell
resonate promises resolve <promise_id> --data true
```

You should see the result of the `download_and_summarize()` workflow printed in the invocation script terminal.

**Congratulations you have just created a human-in-the-loop workflow!**

Now that we have the fundamental building blocks in place, let's make it into a real application.

## Business logic

In this part of the tutorial, you will add the rest of pieces that will convert this theoretical workflow into a real working application that downloads a webpage, summarizes it, and waits for confirmation from a human-in-the-loop.

To do this you will:

- Convert the invocation script into a Flask application (HTTP Gateway) that handles two routes:
  - `/summarize` to start the summarization workflow.
  - `/confirm` to resolve the promise created in the workflow and pass data to the workflow.
- Add a new step to the workflow that "sends an email" with the summary (this will just print the summary and links to confirm or reject it).
- Add Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape the webpage content.
- Add Ollama to summarize the content.

Start by converting the invocation script into a Flask application.

Change the `invoke.py` file to `gateway.py`.

Add `flask` as a dependency to your project:

```shell
uv add flask
```

And change the code in `gateway.py` to the following:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from resonate import Resonate
import json
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

resonate = Resonate.remote(
    group="gateway",
)


# Invoke the download_and_summarize workflow
@app.route("/summarize", methods=["POST"])
def summarize_route_handler():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        if "url" not in data and "email" not in data:
            return jsonify({"error": "URL and email required"}), 400

        params = {}
        params["url"] = data["url"]
        params["email"] = data["email"]
        params["usable_id"] = clean(data["url"])

        # Use Resonate's Async RPC to start the workflow
        _ = resonate.options(target="poll://any@worker").rpc(
            f"download_and_summarize-{params['usable_id']}",
            "download_and_summarize",
            params,
        )

        return jsonify({"summary": "workflow started"}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500


# Handle the confirmation of summarization
@app.route("/confirm", methods=["GET"])
def confirm_route_handler():
    try:

        promise_id = request.args.get("promise_id")
        confirm = request.args.get("confirm")

        if not promise_id or confirm is None:
            return jsonify({"error": "url and confirmation params are required"}), 400

        confirm = confirm.lower() == "true"

        resonate.promises.resolve(
            id=promise_id,
            data=json.dumps(confirm),
        )
        if confirm:
            return jsonify({"message": "Summarization confirmed."}), 200
        else:
            return jsonify({"message": "Summarization rejected."}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500


# Clean the URL to create a usable ID that can be used in file names
def clean(url):
    tmp = re.sub(r"^https?://", "", url)
    return tmp.replace("/", "-")


def main():
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the previous code example, you have created a Flask application with two routes:

- `/summarize`: This route handles the POST request to start the summarization workflow.
  It expects a JSON payload with `url` and `email` fields.
  And all the data has been placed into a dictionary called `params` that is passed to the `download_and_summarize()` workflow.
- `/confirm`: This route handles the GET request to confirm or reject the summarization.
  It expects `promise_id` and `confirm` query parameters.
  Previously we used the CLI to resolve the promise, but now we will resolve it via this route handler and the `promises.resolve()` method.

The `clean()` function is used to create a usable ID from the URL that can be reliably used in file names and promise IDs.

Next you will update the worker (`app.py`).

Add the following dependencies to your project:

```shell
uv add selenium bs4 ollama
```

Then, update the `download()` and `summarize()` functions to use Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape the webpage content and Ollama to summarize it.

```python
import ollama
import os
from selenium import webdriver
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# ...

class NetworkResolutionError(Exception):
    """Permanent DNS resolution failure. Do not retry."""

def download(_, usable_id, url):
    print(f"Downloading content from {url}")
    filename = f"{usable_id}.txt"
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        print(f"File {filename} already exists. Skipping download.")
        return filename

    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    try:
        driver.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, "html.parser")
        content = soup.get_text()
        with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(content)
        driver.quit()
        return filename
    except Exception as e:
        driver.quit()
        if "net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" in str(e):
            raise NetworkResolutionError(f"DNS failure: {e}") from e
        raise Exception(f"Failed to download data: {e}")


def summarize(_, filename):
    print(f"Summarizing content from {filename}")
    try:
        with open(filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            file_content = f.read()

        options: ollama.Options | None = None
        result = ollama.chat(
            model="llama3.1",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You review text scraped from a website and summarize it. Ignore text that does not support the narrative and purpose of the website.",
                },
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Content to summarize: {file_content}"},
            ],
            options=options,
        )
        return result.message.content
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to summarize content: {e}")
```

In the previous code example, the `download()` function uses the Selenium webdrive and Beautiful Soup to scrape the webpage content and then save it to a file.

:::tip Why save to a file?

We can't assume that the amount of data we scrape from a webpage will fit into promise.
A promise can hold quite a bit of data, but it is not designed to hold very large amounts and we can't assume that a website scrape will always fit.
And even if it does, a large amount of data in a promise can lead to performance issues.
So, we save the content to a file and then pass the filename to the `summarize()` function.

:::

We also handle a specific exception for DNS resolution failures, which we can use to control the retry behavior from the workflow — That is, we won't retry if the DNS resolution fails, as it is a permanent error.

Then the `summarize()` function reads the file and uses Ollama to summarize the content.

Next, add a new step to the `download_and_summarize()` that mimics sending an email with the summary and links to confirm or reject the summarization (i.e. resolve the promise that blocks the execution).

```python
@resonate.register
def download_and_summarize(ctx, params):
    url = params["url"]
    usable_id = params["usable_id"]
    email = params["email"]

    # Download the content from the URL and save it to a file
    filename = yield ctx.lfc(download, usable_id, url).options(durable=False, non_retryable_exceptions=(NetworkResolutionError,))
    while True:
        # Summarize the content of the file
        summary = yield ctx.lfc(summarize, filename)

        # Create Durable Promise to block on confirmation
        promise = yield ctx.promise()

        # Send email with summary and confirmation/rejection links
        yield ctx.lfc(send_email, summary, email, promise.id)

        # Wait for summary to be confirmed or rejected / wait for the promise to be resolved
        confirmed = yield promise
        if confirmed:
            break

    print("Workflow completed")
    return summary

# ...

def send_email(_, summary, email, promise_id):
    print(f"Summary: {summary}")
    print(
        f"Click to confirm: http://localhost:5000/confirm?confirm=true&promise_id={promise_id}"
    )
    print(
        f"Click to reject: http://localhost:5000/confirm?confirm=false&promise_id={promise_id}"
    )
    print(f"Email sent to {email} with summary and confirmation links.")
    return
```

In the previous code example, the `download_and_summarize()` function now includes a step that sends an email with the summary and links to confirm or reject the summarization.
Instead of printing the promise ID and using the CLI to resolve the promise, we use the `send_email()` function to print the summary and the links to confirm or reject the summarization.
The links will point to the `/confirm` endpoint of the Flask application, which will resolve the promise when clicked.

This is more realistic, as it mimics a real-world scenario where a human would receive an email with the summary and links to confirm or reject the summarization.

Additionally you can see that we set a options on the `download()` step:

- `options(durable=False)` means that the result of the `download()` step will not be stored in a promise.
  This is because, we save the file to disk.
  If the worker crashes, it is possible that the workflow will recover on a different worker, and the file will not be available.
  So, in this case we do want to re-download the content if the worker crashes.
- `non_retryable_exceptions=(NetworkResolutionError,)` means that if the `download()` step raises a `NetworkResolutionError`, it will not be retried.
  This is because a DNS resolution failure is a permanent error, and we don't want to retry the download in this case.

Now run the worker and the gateway in separate terminals:

```shell
uv run app
```

```shell
uv run src/gateway.py
```

Now you can start the summarization workflow by sending a POST request to the `/summarize` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the `url` and `email` fields.

For example, you can use cURL to send the request:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://resonatehq.io", "email": "johndoe@example.com"}'
```

You should see the worker downloading the content from the URL, summarizing it, and then sending an "email" with the summary and links to confirm or reject the summarization.

If you click on the confirm link, you should see the workflow complete and the summary printed in the worker terminal.

If you click on the reject link, the workflow will run the summarization step again, and you will receive a new summary.

**Congratulations, you have just built a website summarization AI agent with Resonate!**

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you've gained hands-on experience with Resonate’s implementation of the Distributed Async Await programming model and explored core features of the SDK, including:

- Automatic application-level retries: Functions that raise exceptions are automatically retried until success (unless configured otherwise).
- Crash recovery and Durable Execution: By connecting your worker to a Resonate Server, you enabled recovery from process crashes without losing workflow progress.
- Asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls (Async RPC): You separated function invocation from execution, enabling workers to process tasks in other processes or machines.
- Human-in-the-loop orchestration: You paused a workflow and resumed it based on human input using durable promises.
- Fine-grained control over execution behavior: You chose when to enable durability, configured retry policies, and marked specific exceptions as non-retryable for permanent failures.

The final application is:

- Distributed: Workload is load-balanced across workers in the same group.
- Durable: Intermediate results persist across crashes when connected to a Resonate Server.
- Scalable: You can run multiple workers and clients with no changes to your code.
- Composable: All steps (scraping, summarizing, approval flow) are reusable and decoupled.
